# TherapyTracker

3/28/2016

Known bugs:

-When adding time to a patients appointment, conflicts do not check
surrounding appointments for the therapist.

-Not confirmed, however, other bugs likely exist with time conflicts


Modified features:

-Objective B.III.c

	Due to complexity, had to simplify feature to only rearrange the schedule. 

	Element now takes current patient, and adds it to the end of the
	therapists schedule. 


Current version comes with a building implemented. This includes a director, three therapists, and 8 patients. Appointments are also included for therapists.

	Time conflicts (from a patient's perspective) are not pre-coded in, however they can easily be added through the nurse menu.
